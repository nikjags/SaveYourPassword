# Introduction
A pet-project of a simple console application that allow you to create and maintain your **own** password repository based on Google Drive.

# Main idea
To store your login-password pairs from everything requiring authentication.

# TL;DR How to get it?
All you need is:
- Java virtual machine ([download](https://www.google.com));
- [The application itself](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ipiAeO5dnBuWN0cZ6QFri690GKKuR7TQ/view?usp=sharing)
- Google account.

Extract all files into your favorite folder.

# How to use it?
Click on **Save your password.bat** stored in **bin/** folder to run.

## Create your first password repository
After app starts, select "Create a new Google Drive password repository" by typing corresponding symbol 
(i don't know if i should teach github boys how to use a console app, but ok).

Next, you will find yourself in the main part of the program, where you can add new login-pass pairs, find or edit existing ones, and save changes into repository.

### What is this "tag" thing?
Tag field is used to represent an affiliation with something requiring login-password: sites, games, your office computer, etc.

You can write there everything you want; but remember: this field is used for login-pass pairs search, so write something what makes sense to future version of yours.

## Save your changes
First save is managing a connection with GDrive, creates folder and uploads a password file to store it; it's also creates a key file.

### What should i do with key file?
